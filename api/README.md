# ASPICE Platform — API Server

REST API for the Automotive ASPICE Documentation Platform.
Built with **FastAPI** + **Python 3.12**, backed by either an in-memory store
(default) or a JSON-file store.  The API drives the real **analyzer pipeline**
(`run.py`) for analysis jobs and reads its actual output for documents,
functions, render, download, and compare.

---

## Quick start

```bash
# Install dependencies (from repo root)
pip install -r api/requirements.txt

# Start the server (in-memory DB, simulated seed data)
uvicorn api.main:app --reload --port 8000

# Start with JSON DB (persists across restarts)
API_DB_BACKEND=json uvicorn api.main:app --reload --port 8000
```

| URL | Description |
|---|---|
| http://localhost:8000/docs | Swagger UI (interactive) |
| http://localhost:8000/redoc | ReDoc |
| http://localhost:8000/health | Health check |

### Sign in

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/auth/signin \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email": "alice@aspice.dev", "password": "secret"}'
```

Seed users (all use password `secret`):

| Email | Role | Projects |
|---|---|---|
| alice@aspice.dev | Admin | VCU Engine Firmware, ADAS Sensor Fusion |

**Total routes: 70** across all routers.

### Design principles

- **Domain models are pure dataclasses** (`api/models/domain.py`).  Routes and
  services work only with these — zero ORM import anywhere except the DB adapter.

- **Repository pattern** (`api/repositories/interfaces.py`).  Every concrete
  storage adapter must implement the abstract classes here.  Switching databases
  means writing one new adapter; no route or service changes.

- **One injection point** (`api/db/session.py`).  `get_db()` is a FastAPI
  dependency.  Replace the instantiation inside it to swap backends.

- **Real pipeline, not a simulation**.  `POST /jobs` spawns a daemon thread that
  shells out to `run.py` via `pipeline_runner.py`.  The thread:
  1. Clones/checks out the commit into `workspaces/<project_id>/<sha16>/`.
  2. Writes a per-project `config.json` from `build_config` + `architecture_layers`.
  3. Runs `run.py` as a subprocess and tails its output for SSE events.
  4. On completion, registers a real `Version` and `Documents` from `output/` dirs.
  5. Captures a version snapshot to `workspaces/<project_id>/versions/<id>/` for
     future compare/diff calls.

- **Role enforcement is server-side**.  `require_project_admin` /
  `require_project_member` are called at the start of every protected handler.

## Storage backends

### In-memory (`API_DB_BACKEND=memory`)

Default.  Seeded with five users, three projects, versions, commits, jobs,
documents, and sample sections.  Resets on restart.  Ideal for development
and demos.

### JSON files (`API_DB_BACKEND=json`)

Persists every aggregate to `api/db/data/*.json`.  Write-through: every
`create`/`update`/`delete` flushes to disk atomically.  On startup, if
`model/functions.json` exists (written by the pipeline) it is overlaid on the
functions store so the API reflects the latest run.

## Error envelope

All errors return a consistent JSON body:

```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "DOCUMENT_NOT_FOUND",
    "message": "Document doc_999 does not exist in this project.",
    "status": 404
  }
}
```

---

## Real-time (SSE)

Connect to `GET /api/v1/projects/:id/jobs/:jobId/events`:

```bash
curl -N -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" \
  http://localhost:8000/api/v1/projects/p1/jobs/job1/events
```

Event types: `phase_update`, `activity_update`, `log_line`,
`job_complete`, `job_failed`.

---

## Swapping the database

1. Implement every ABC in `api/repositories/interfaces.py`
   (12 classes: `IUserRepository`, `IProjectRepository`, etc.)

2. Create your adapter class (e.g. `PostgresDatabase`) with the same
   attribute names as `InMemoryDatabase`.

3. In **`api/db/session.py`** replace the one line:

   ```python
   # Before
   _db = InMemoryDatabase()

   # After
   _db = PostgresDatabase(dsn=os.environ["DATABASE_URL"])
   ```

4. Done — no route or service file needs to change.
